## Welcome to GitHub Pages [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS"><img src="https://dzwonsemrish7.cloudfront.net/items/1Q3S3H0L1C1V2e2B2v3T/css3-logo.svg" width="125" align="right" alt="CSS Logo"></a>

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/saurabhprasadsah/Project_Todo_List_jQuery_Bootstrap/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/saurabhprasadsah/Project_Todo_List_jQuery_Bootstrap/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
